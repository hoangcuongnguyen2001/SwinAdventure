# SwinAdventure
This is the game I made in Object-Oriented Programming unit (using C#), in which the player could handle things in a bag and move to different locations. 

Note: The folders SwinAdventureMain and GUI SwinAdventure indicate two different versions of the game: in command prompt and in GUI, both of them use classes from the folder Swin Adventure. The folder SwinAdventureUnitTest is the unit test performed for the game.
