# SwinAdventure
This is the game I made in Object-Oriented Programming unit (using C#), in which the player could handle things in a bag and move to different locations. 
Note: The folders SwinAdventure and GUI SwinAdventure indicate two different versions of the game: in command prompt and in GUI. The folder SwinAdventureUnitTest is the unit test performed for the game.
